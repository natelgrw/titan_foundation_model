Notice from spectre at use_tran = 1 during IC analysis, during transient
        analysis `transwp-000_mytran', during Sweep analysis `transwp'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is
        recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Convergence achieved in 24 iterations.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `transwp-000_mytran', during
        Sweep analysis `transwp'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(MM2:int_si) = 1 V
I: I(E2:p) = 1.507 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.
